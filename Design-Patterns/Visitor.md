# Visitor Design Pattern in C++


## WHY?

Best understood in relation with Iterators: 
- Where Iterator pattern hides away the "Traversal" mechanism of your data, the Visitor pattern aditionally separates away any "Analysis" done on your data also.

## Best Application?
e.g. 

1.  Public APIS that can be extended by clients:
-   When you cannot modify the existing class heirachy e.g. if your using from another library:
- You can Use the Visitor to add new operations to the class-heirachy without modifying it.
